This repo contains scripts I have written for interacting with 
the ThreatGrid API. These scripts are not supported by Cisco. TAC will not be able to assist you with any problems you encounter. Use the scripts at your own risk. Neither I nor Cisco will be held responisble if you shoot yourself in the foot.
